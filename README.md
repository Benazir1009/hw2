# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is dedicated to analyzing passenger data from the legendary Titanic, contained in the **Titanic_Dataset.csv** dataset. We explore the relationship between passenger age groups and their ticket class (**Pclass**).

## ðŸ”„ Data Transformation
Passenger ages were categorized into the following groups:
-  **Infants**
-  **Children**
-  **Teenagers**
-  **Young Adults**
-  **Middle-Aged**
-  **Elderly**

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis
To examine the relationship between passenger age and ticket class (**Pclass**), a **Chi-square test** was applied. The resulting **p-value < 0.05** confirms a statistically significant correlation between these variables.
